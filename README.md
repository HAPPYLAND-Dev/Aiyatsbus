# Aiyatsbus
> A splendid plugin for more enchants in paper spigot 1.16+.

Aiyatsbus is a enchantment framework for Minecraft Java Version, whose predecessor is NereusOpus 2.0. However, Aiyatsbus itself provides not only lots of new enchantments, but also an amazing framework for creating unique enchantments of you own, like providing some magic tools to access to events, blocks entities or other objects, helping you add more fun to the game through **Kether** script syntax.

- In 2.x, all enchantments in NereusOpus were hard coded, while now Aiyatsbus allows users to customize enchantments
- Aiyatsbus is offered under the GPL-3.0 License, which means you can create your own features by coding.
- Free (with **limited** services).

Along with the 3.0 update, we believe that the 2.0 code is too cumbersome and unintelligent, this has become troublesome. A plugin which is exquisitely rewritten with efficient framework, which is highly customizable, which is stable, which is easy-to-use, is what we need. So it was a foregone conclusion that a huge update to v3.0 was in order, in which we carefully redesigned every single component of NereusOpus, and we changed a name, and it just becomes Aiyatsbus.
